# OIBSIP_TaskNo.1
The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to create a professional-quality landing page that could serve as the front face of an e-commerce platform. This project not only showcases my skills in web development but also my capacity to work on real-world projects as part of an internship program.
